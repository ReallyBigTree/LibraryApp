1- First download the book.csv file from here

2- Your program should include a class Book that contains data reflecting the columns in the dataset table

3- Using regular expressions and the string library, build a function to read the file record by record and stores them into a List of Book objects.

4-  Implement two versions of this program one that uses ArrayLists and one that uses LinkedLists. You should be able to do that without duplicating all the code. (hint: review Task 1 of Assignment 2)

5- Your app should show the top 10 records in your list. 

6- Your app should allow the user to search for a certain book using book_id or isbn

7- Your app should allow the user to change the sorting of the list to be sorted based on 

  a) authors 

  b) original publication 

in both ascending or descending order. 


8- For the book search feature implement the following:

for the ArrayList 

a) Binary search 

for the LinkedList 

b) linear search 

9) create a separate method to test the performance of the algorithms in 8.

Compare the performance of the 2 methods by searching in the underling data structure for a large number of values. These values could be taken from the data set. (suggested number 500 values, if no difference is seen they could be increased to a 1000)

10) Report the running time for each of the two methods.
